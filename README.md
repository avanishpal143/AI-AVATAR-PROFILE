## Assignment Questions

### Part 2: Short Questions

1. **If this was a real SaaS tool, what 2 features would you prioritize next and why?**

   I would prioritize:
   
   - AI-powered avatar generation: This would allow users to create custom avatars with text prompts, bringing true value to the "AI" part of the dashboard and giving users a compelling reason to use the service.
   
   - Avatar style customization options: Providing tools to customize avatar characteristics (hair, clothing, accessories) would make the platform more engaging and personalized, increasing user retention.

2. **What was one challenge you faced in this task, and how did you solve or approach it?**

   One challenge was creating a responsive layout that works well across device sizes while maintaining visual appeal. I approached this by using Tailwind's responsive utility classes and tested extensively across different viewport sizes. I used grid layouts with dynamic column counts based on screen width to ensure the cards display optimally on any device.

### Part 3: Video Answer Question

"What's one fun or ambitious feature you'd build into this platform if you had full freedom?"

[The candidate would record a 30-60 second video answering this question.]
